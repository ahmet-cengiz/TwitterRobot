# TwitterRobot
That application can be used for following or unfollowing 500-1000 people. You should give a twitter name that contains people(as follower) you want to follow.
Assume there is a popular account named "AccA" related to your account "AccB" somehow. 
If you want followers of AccA to follow your account AccB, you can poke them by following them for a while.
You should give name of the AccA in middle textbox.
