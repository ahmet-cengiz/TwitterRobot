# TwitterRobot

This application can be used for following or unfollowing 500-1000 people. You should give a twitter name that contains people(as follower) you want to follow.
Assume there is a popular account named "AccA" related to your account "AccB" somehow. 
If you want followers of AccA to follow your account AccB too, you can poke them by following them for a while.
You should give name of the AccA in middle textbox and then click "follower sayısı" button.
After you specify the interval of follower amount, click "verilen aralığı takip et"

Fill the twitter API key values related to your account.
And you should check twitter API rate limits before using the app.

Note that the source code of this application is a little bit trash but it works :)
